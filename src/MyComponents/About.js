        Welcome to the <strong>React To-Do App</strong>!  This app helps you
        manage your daily tasks in a simple and organized way. You can easily
        <em> add, delete, and track </em> your todos.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        The app is built using <strong>React</strong> with concepts like
        components, state, props, and routing. Your todos are saved in
        <strong> localStorage</strong>, so they wonâ€™t disappear when you refresh
        the page.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        This project is mainly for learning React basics, but it can also serve
        as a foundation for more advanced apps.
